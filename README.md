# Algorithms and Data Structures in Swift

This repository contains a *work in progress* **Xcode Playground** containing Data Structures, Algorithms
and Programming Interviews code challenges implemented in the [Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).

The goal of this repository is simply to collect the most famous Data Structures and Algorithms
that all programmers should know, explain how they work, and contextualize their usage with concrete examples.

As a bonus, the code challenges solved in the Playground can help while excercising while preparing for Coding Interviews.
The programming challenges solved in this Playground are collected from several sources: interview preparation websites and books,
forums online, actual interviews I've been into as either the interviewee or interviewer.
