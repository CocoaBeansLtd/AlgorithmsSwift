 # Buy and sell a stock once
 ### Write a program that takes an array of nonnegative real numbers, denoting the daily stock price for a company, and returns the maximum profit that could be made by buying and selling a single stock over that time period.
 E.g. Given the array [310, 315, 275, 295, 260, 270, 290, 230, 255, 250] the result should be 30
 which is the profit that can be made by buying the stock when itâ€™s valued 260 and sell it at 290.
